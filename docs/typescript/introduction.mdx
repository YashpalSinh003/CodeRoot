### What is type in TypeScript ?
Type in defining what kind of operation can be performed on given data, type describe how the data should be handled. 

  * JS is weakly typed means once type is declared it can be re-declared or reassigned to different type
  * TS is strongly typed, Ts want to stick initial type only.

### How we can declare types in TypeScript ?
- We can use Js Doc comments to declare types (Not recommended):
