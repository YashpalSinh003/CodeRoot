# Declaring Types in TS

### Union types:

- Union types are a powerful way to express a value that can be one of the several types. We use the vertical bar (|) to separate each type, so 'number | string | boolean' is the type of a value that can be a number, a string, or a boolean.


```js
//Union Types
function printId(id: number | string) {
    console.log(id);
}

printId(101); // OK
printId("Yash"); // OK
//Below code will throw an error
printId({ age:30}); // Error
```

- **Discriminated Unions**:


In this section we'll look at a common pattern TypeScript developers use to structure their code. It's called a 'discriminated union'.

To understand what a discriminated union is, let's first look at the problem it solves.

### The Problem: The Bag Of Optionals

Let's imagine we are modelling a data fetch. We have a `State` type with a `status` property which can be in one of three states: `loading`, `success`, or `error`.

```typescript
type State = {
    status: "loading" | "success" | "error";
};
```

This is useful, but we also need to capture some extra data. The data coming back from the fetch, or the error message if the fetch fails.

We could add an `error` and `data` property to the `State` type:

```typescript
type State = {
    status: "loading" | "success" | "error";
    error?: string;
    data?: string;
};
```

And let's imagine we have a `renderUI` function that returns a string based on the input.

```typescript
const renderUI = (state: State) => {
    if (state.status === "loading") {
        return "Loading...";
    }

    if (state.status === "error") {
        return `Error: ${state.error.toUpperCase()}`; // Red line under state.error
    }

    if (state.status === "success") {
        return `Data: ${state.data}`;
    }
};
```

This all looks good, except for the error we're getting on `state.error`. TypeScript is telling us that `state.error` could be `undefined`, and we can't call `toUpperCase` on `undefined`.

This is because we've declared our `State` type in an incorrect way. We've made it so the `error` and `data` properties are _not related to the statuses where they occur_. In other words, it's possible to create types which will never happen in our app:

```typescript
const state: State = {
    status: "loading",
    error: "This is an error", // should not happen on "loading!"
    data: "This is data", // should not happen on "loading!"
};
```

### Solution: Discriminated Unions

```typescript
type State ={
    | {
        status:"Loading"
    }
    |{
        status:"Success";data:string
    }
    |{
        status:"error";error:string
    }
}
```

- This is due to TypeScript's narrowing - it knows that `state.status` is `"error"`, so it knows that `state.error` is a `string` inside of the `if` block.



* #### Literal Types:
    TypeScript allow us to create types that are made from javascript primitive values (string,number,boolean), these type are called primitive types.

```js
    type YesOrNo = "yes" | "no";
    type StatusCode = 200 | 404 | 500;
    type TrueOrFalse = true | false;
```


## Type Aliases & Interfaces:

* Type aliases allows to define types with custom name and use them in place of actual type.
* So in short with aliases and interface we can create re-usable types.
  
```js
//Type Aliases
type CarYear = number;
type CarModel = string;
type Car = {
    year: CarYear,
    model: CarModel
};

const carYear: CarYear = 2001
const carModel: CarModel = "Corolla"
const car: Car = {
    year: carYear,
    model: carModel
    };
```

* Interfaces are similar to aliases but they are only used with objects.


```js
// Try creating a new interface using it below
interface Rectangle {
    height: number,
    width: number
};
        
const rectangle: Rectangle = {
    height: 20,
    width: 10
};
```

- **Intersections**: we can combine two interfaces or type aliases using ** & ** operator to create a new type.

```js
interface A { // interface
    a: number;
}
interface B { // interface
    b: string;
}
type C = A & B; // intersection type
const c: C = { a: 1, b: "hi" };
```

- ** It's recommended to use interface extends rather than intersection as interface will give error while merging tow incompatible types but intersection will not give error and will merge two types.**

```typescript
interface A { // interface
    a: number;
}
interface B { // interface
    b: string;
}
interface C extends A,B { // intersection type
    c: boolean;
}
const c: C = { a: 1, b: "hi", c: true };
``` 

- **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYPE ALIASES AND INTERFACES**:

    1. **Type aliases** can represent any type, including primitives, unions, and intersections.
    2. **Interfaces** can only represent object types.
    3. Main thing to keep in mind that **Interfaces** are open and **Type aliases** are closed, means we can **extend** interface by re-declaring it second time while we can't do this with type aliases.

```js
interface Car {
    model: string;
}
// Here we declare car interface again and this will extend or add year type to Car interface.
interface Car { 
    year: number;
}

let carObj: Car = { // This will work fine
    model: "Corolla",
    year: 2001
}

type Bike = {
    model: string;
}
// This will throw an error,as we can do intersection with type aliases but we can't extend it.
type Bike = { // This will throw an error
    year: number;
}
```

- **Type aliases** are more flexible than interfaces, because they can represent primitives, unions, and intersections. **Type aliases** are also more suitable for describing the shape of any data.

## Left hand typing vs Right hand typing:

Left Hand Typing:
	We annotate using the colon syntax, the name is of the type we annotate.
    let deliveryAddress: string[] = []

Right Hand Typing:
    Type annotation is not explicitly defined and inferred by type script, so here type is derived  by a value assigned to the right side of the equal sign.
