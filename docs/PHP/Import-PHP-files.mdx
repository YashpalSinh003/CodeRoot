# Importing PHP Files

To import PHP files in another PHP file, we can use the `include` or `require` statement.

## Include Statement:
* Include load the another PHP file using relative path, and if the file is not found, it will generate a warning.
* Include_once does the same, but onlr for the first time.*

```php
include ('../file.php');
include_once ('../files.php');
```

## Require Statement:
* Require does the same, but if the file is not found, **it will generate a fatal error.**

* Require_once does the same, but only for the first time.

```php
require ('../file.php');
require_once ('../files.php');
```
